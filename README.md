# emotionsExploration

Final project outline for class [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project I’m proposing is focusing on difficult emotions we as humans process. The initial page on the project includes 3 objects which represent the 3 emotional states. As the user choses 1 state at a time, she enters an experience of learning how to cope with this emotion or emotional challenge. The user is taken through a series of visuals which animate the emotional experience and suggest a coping strategy. The user goes through the experience which is enhanced by both visuals and sound. The visuals are represented mostly by videos which are layered and form a continuous sequence. The sound is selected to enhance the visuals. Another layer of sound is offered as an additional feature where the user hears a voice over narrative the coping strategy for each experience. As the experience ends, the user is prompted to go back to the initial page and chooses to explore another object representing emotions. The techniques used for the creation of the project are css and javascript animations, as well as Web GL with three.js objects. With this project I’m hoping to create a unique experience where human emotions are explored through the sense of the user and this way both validated and hopefully explained with more perceived clarity.
